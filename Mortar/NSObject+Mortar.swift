/// Provides default MortarCreatable support for all NSObject-based
/// classes.  This is included in the default Mortar spec for backwards
/// compatibility but may break codebases that contain class definitions
/// that do not always wish to expose init().  For those codebases
/// they should use:
///
/// pod 'Mortar/Core_NoCreatable'
///
/// and can put this code to allow `create` to be used on classes:
///
/// extension (your-class-name): MortarCreatable { }
extension NSObject: MortarCreatable { }
